## Images WebP

We use **webp** format for non SVG images on the site. When we get new image from designer do this:
1. Copy PNG image to */src/img/org* folder
2. Run script */src/img/img.sh*

This will create .webp images in /src/img folder whose max size would be 512px. In order to run scrip you need to install the following aps:
- cwebp
- pngcrush
- sips
