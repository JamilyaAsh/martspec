🍫 — Rectangle
🍓 — Strawberry or Triangle";

"Pear DESC"="Hips are wider than the chest/bust. Buttock and thigh areas are larger than the rest of the body. The waist is well-defined. Weight tends to form at the bottom of the body. Studies are controversial regarding the health risks of this body shape.";
"Glass NAME"="Hourglass";
"Glass DESC"="Well balanced body. Bust/chest and hips have similar measurements, waist is small and well-defined. Weight gain can be hard to spot without checking the scale often.";
"Rect NAME"="Rectangle";

• Hips size is measured around the largest part of your hips — the widest part of your buttocks.

🚼 FERTILITY
Women with WHR of 0.7-0.8 tend to have optimal estrogen levels and higher pregnancy rates than women with WHR above 0.8. Men with WHRs around 0.9 are more healthy and fertile.

❗While BMI is the most widely used general indicator of body health, it has its limitations. BMI is only an estimate; it does not account for body composition.

HOW TO MEASURE
• Waist size is measured around the smallest part of your waist, just above your belly button.

CONSISTS OF:
• Essential fat  —  maintains life and reproductive functions and is typically between 10 and 13% in females and 2 and 5% in males.
• Storage fat  — insulates the body to retain heat and stores energy substrate for metabolism. It accumulates mostly beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat) and around the major organs (visceral fat) in the body.

FUNCTION:
Lipids delivery that the body uses to generate energy. Body fat accumulation is influenced by food intake, exercise and genetic factors.

❗Reducing fat is not the same as reducing body weight. Simply lowering caloric intake is not sufficient. Losing 2% of body fat in 30 days is possible.

❗Excess or insufficient body fat can lead to detrimental health effects.";
