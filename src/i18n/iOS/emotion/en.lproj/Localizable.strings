If the tension is high, your strength is spent on maintaining mental integrity, combating personal problems, overcoming fatigue, etc. That leads to lower productivity.

For example, working long under constant volitional tension; constant lack of opportunity for proper rest; as well as severe chronic diseases that deplete the body, - all cause a significant increase in mental tension and lower productivity.

High mental tension manifests itself in limited social activity and regular cases of “tiredness of everything”. No strength to even set new goals. Lack of confidence.  The mood is dominated by an anxious expectation of trouble. Disappointment with the life course. Your brain redirects all energy to dampen problems and reconcile opposing motives. Your attention is routed to the tense inner world.

When your productivity is low you better stop what you are doing and rest. There is no point to continue with the current task because your productivity is not optimal.";

An absence of well-defined motives makes you reactive and purposeless. The mood can fluctuate between excitement and depression in the shortest time possible. The whole emotional state is dominated by anxiety, a premonition of trouble, and a lack of desire to do anything. Your reaction and handling of an extreme situation is unreliable.";
"P2"="Your potential is low while unproductive mental tension is high. You force yourself to do certain things. Constant self-control increases fatigue. Prolonged intensive work might cost you dearly in terms of health. That cost will be very unequal to what you will be able to accomplish. Emotionally you experience anxiety, increased excitability, and uncertainty.  In a stressful situation, disruption of activity and behavior is likely.";

In a familiar environment, you move from work to rest and back, from one type of activity to another without significant difficulties.

To keep up good health and performance you need a clear division of work and rest time.";

We wish to achieve something. Perhaps we are trying to remove something from our lives. Of course, this creates a little stress. This is normal and is not a conflict, it is an incentive to action.\n\n\"Actual Problem\" always has several sides. It includes both the source of stress and the one who is trying to solve it. For example, a boss at work. The boss himself is not a problem. This becomes a problem when someone starts interacting with that person, trying to figure out HOW to solve a work situation in a certain way.\nSo the key to solving the problem is \"HOW\".";

That causes isolation and leads to a strong desire to merge with others. That might be even to the detriment of a sense of self-confidence. A decrease in self-confidence is perceived as a weakness. You try to fight it with the help of apparent firmness and external determination. You believe constant self-control is the only way to asset yourself as an individual. You think only this allows to maintain your position despite real difficulties.";
"-6-2"="📌 Excessive self-control, aimed at winning the respect of others.\n\nWHY: You desire to stand out from the crowd and want to unite with people with the same high living standards. This leads to high stress. However, you keep your attitude despite a lack of appreciation. You find the situation unpleasant and want a way out of the situation but refuse to sacrifice your own beliefs. You constantly postpone making the vital decision due to doubts about your ability to resist possible opposition. You need recognition from others, agreement with your wishes, and respect for your views. Only then you can feel safe and at ease.";
"-6-3"="📌 Lack of attention to the body's needs. Suppression of sexual or physical desires.\n\nWHY: The current situation seems threatening. You feel underestimated. Among equals, you do not feel the necessary security. You seek recognition and respect from others. The self-control of sensuality makes it difficult to give yourself. This leads to isolation and causes uncertainty, a desire to give in and merge with others. You consider this insecurity to be a drawback and mask it with apparent self-confidence, determination, and manner of expression. By doing so, you seek to evoke a sense of superiority and establish yourself. You need recognition, attention and admiration of your traits by others. You want to look like a worthy partner in the eyes of others.";
"-6-4"="📌 Anxiety hidden behind self-confidence and indifference.\n\nWHY: The current situation looks unpleasant and uncertain.  You are unable to become a member of a society that satisfies your high demands. You want to stand out from the crowd. This brings a sense of loneliness and uncertainty. Isolation feeling causes a strong need for connection. It is given the main importance, everything else is secondary. The interest circle has narrowed. Even physical pleasures fade away. However, this need contradicts your idea of controlling your desires. This leads to tension. You want to prove to others the uniqueness of your character. You try to suppress the need for contact with other people. You unconsciously hide the fear of inferiority and put on an appearance of careless confidence and external determination. You strive to win the respect of others. You behave yourself with apparent independence and swagger. Anyone critical of such behavior is faced with dismissive indifference. However, behind the assumed indifference you hide a thirst for approval and esteem of others.";
"-6-5"="📌 Increased sensitivity. A relationship does not stay desired.\n\nWHY: You are responsive and sensitive to the softness and subtlety of feelings. In a relationship, you crave mystical fusion and erotic fascination. This desire stays unsatisfied due to the lack of a suitable partner or due to unfavorable circumstances. You keep your emotional relationships under strict control and believe it helps to know what you can count on. An aesthete, you have a well-mannered and refined taste that lets you formulate your preferences and opinions, especially in the field of art and artistic creativity. You seek to establish connections with those who can contribute to your intellectual or artistic growth.";
"-6-7"="📌 Unpleasant restrictions or prohibitions. A desire for independence.\n\nWHY: You want to freely follow your beliefs and principles. You wish to develop your abilities and gain respect for yourself as an individual. You hope your activity and diligence will eliminate internal contradictions. You pursue your interests and fight against interference. You strive to use every opportunity to act without obeying any restrictions and prohibitions. You ignore your body's needs and use the energy at your disposal to achieve as much as possible.";

"-7"="📌 Rising tension.\n\nWHY: You strive to act freely and independently. You dismiss any hindrances, restrictions and prohibitions except the ones that are imposed by you.";
"-7-0"="📌 Increased sensitivity and involvement.\n\nWHY: You strive to overcome the joyless emptiness and disconnection. You believe life should give much more than it gives. You are afraid to miss your share of life's benefits if unable to make the best use of each case. You follow your goals with frantic strength and get involved so deep that often exceeds your authority. You offer services and expertise whenever possible and consider yourself quite competent in any field. Therefore, you often get considered annoying and intrusive, interfering in other people's affairs.";
"-7-1"="📌 Striving for independence is due to emotional unhappiness.\n\nWHY: You perceive your situation or relationship as dissatisfying and see no way for improvement without the voluntary cooperation of others. As a result, you become incapable of heartfelt affection and devotion. You hide your vulnerability and think showing affection or excessive frankness is wrong. The current relationship seems like a burden. You want independence and a path clear of obstacles. At the same time, you do not want to take a risk or limit yourself in anything. All this causes increased and impatient reactions. Parallel desire to get rid of all this leads to severe anxiety and weakens your ability to focus.";
"-7-2"="📌 Frustration at intolerable restrictions on your freedom of action.\n\nWHY: You strive for independence and freedom from any restrictions. You seek to avoid hindrances, responsibilities, everything that limits your freedom. You hope it will help you to avoid unpleasant relationships and stress. You feel a lot of pressure and want a way out but lack stamina and determination.";
"-7-3"="📌 Frustration is caused by undesirable situation.\n\nWHY: You feel helpless in this unbearably painful situation and powerless to resolve it. You are irritated by the inability to achieve your goal. That leads to nervous exhaustion. You want to get out of that situation and do not feel restrictions anymore. You desire to gain the freedom to decide and act.";
"-7-4"="📌 Self-defense against further failures.\n\nWHY: Unrealized expectations caused doubt and intense alertness. You want to act freely and reject any control except for self-control. You do not want to limit yourself to anything. You crave reliable guarantees of protection from further problems or position loss. You do not believe the situation will improve. This leads to a limiting of your desires, increasing demands and a refusal to make reasonable compromises.";
"-7-5"="📌 Unpleasant prohibitions or restrictions.\n\nWHY: Sensitive and impressionable. You are inclined to get carried away and admire. You seek an idealized and not yet realized situation with complete harmony of feelings and aspirations. You desire deep mutual understanding and dream up of a connection full of coherence of feelings and mutual understanding. You believe that would make life interesting. Since such an idealized contact is unrealistic, the expectations are not met. This causes tension. You try to suppress the tension. You accept only an ideal relationship and do not allow any interference with personal interests. You believe too easy trusting others would lead to a risk that they will take advantage of it. Therefore, you require proof of sincerity. You strictly monitor your standing.";
"-7-6"="📌 You disagree with prohibitions or restrictions.\n\nWHY: You demand independence and resist any pressure from others. You want to make decisions by yourself, without anyone's intervention. You hate monotony and mediocrity and feel disgusted by the equalizing impersonal approach. You are practically unable to admit your own mistakes because you assume your own opinion is the most authoritative. You need to make an effort on yourself to recognize the other's point of view. You strive to prove yourself as a person and stand out thanks to your successes.";
